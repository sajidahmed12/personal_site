I’m a graduate student at the Noth South University, Dhaka Bangladesh. Currently Employed as a Lab Instructor and Research Scientist at North South University. I am broadly interested in Computer Vision basesh Research and their applications, particularly in how can we solve drive scene in Bangladesh Using Semantic Segmentation with the field of deep learning and computer vision, or generated automatically driving assistant systems for a third world country like ours. I graduated from NSU in 2019 with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineeing where I was fortunate enough to get to work as an Research Assitant(RA) with Assistant Professor Dr. Tanzilur Rahman and earlier with Senior Lecturer Ms Tanjilah Farah.
